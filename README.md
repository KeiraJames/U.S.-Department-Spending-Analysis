# U.S. Department Spending Analysis  

## Overview  
This project analyzes U.S. Treasury Daily Statements to identify spending trends, highlight inefficiencies, and detect discrepancies across government departments. By leveraging **Python (Pandas)** in **Jupyter Notebook**, I processed and explored financial datasets to break down expenditures and uncover key insights.  

The findings are visualized in an **interactive Tableau dashboard**, making complex financial data more accessible and actionable for policy analysts, researchers, and the public.  

## Why This Matters  
- **Transparency**: Provides a clear breakdown of federal spending by department.  
- **Accountability**: Identifies inconsistencies or potential inefficiencies in government expenditures.  
- **Decision-Making**: Supports data-driven fiscal oversight and more responsible budget allocation.  

## Methodology  
1. **Data Extraction & Cleaning**: Used Python and Pandas to preprocess U.S. Treasury Daily Statements.  
2. **Analysis**: Categorized spending by department, tracked historical trends, and flagged anomalies.  
3. **Visualization**: Created an interactive Tableau dashboard for easy exploration of spending patterns.
